# AASLabs Payment Gateway (aka APG) API Docs

How to connect your application to AASLabs Payment Gateway

## What is this gateway for

This gateway is a middleware that makes easy the connection between different applications and services that needs to accept payments with Chilean cards.


## What do I need to connect

Not much really, APG is designed to be easy to implement, does not matter the language, application or service that you use to connect. You just need to send a POST request to the APG Server including all the order information, and then you will have a reply telling that the process is finished. After that you will need to send an other request to verify the transaction information.

## How does APG server work.

### Dashboards

### Endpoints

#### Production Endpoints

* Server : https://sv1.tbk.cristiantala.cl/tbk/v2/
* Create Transaction [POST] : https://sv1.tbk.cristiantala.cl/tbk/v2/initTransaction

#### Development EndPoints

* Server : https://dev-env.sv1.tbk.cristiantala.cl/tbk/v2
* Create Transaction [POST] : https://dev-env.sv1.tbk.cristiantala.cl/tbk/v2/initTransaction


### Creating an order

You create an order sending the following information as POST. You need to redirect the post also to the ENDPOINT, so we recommend using a form to POST the data.

EndPoint : https://sv1.tbk.cristiantala.cl/tbk/v2/initTransaction
       
       $pago_args = array(
            'ct_monto'
            'ct_order_id'
            'ct_email'
            'ct_token_service'
            'ct_token_tienda'
            'ct_firma'
        );

| Variable        | Type           | Size  | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| ct_monto     | int | 11 | This value corresponds to the ammount of the order. Chilean currency only uses int values |
| ct_order_id     | varchar      |   45 | This variable correspond to the Order Id of the store. It is AlphaNumeric |
| ct_email | varchar     |    255| This email corresponds to the clients eMail. He will get a confirmation email if the process was successfull. |
| ct_token_service | varchar      |    255 | This variable corresponds to the token that APG gives you to use teh service |
|ct_token_tienda | varchar     |    61 | This variable is random, and is the one that makes possible to retrieve the information of the transaction later on. It must be keep on the server to make teh query later |
|ct_firma | varchar     |    255 | This variable corresponds to the result of the message signed. |

If all the information was sent correctly and you have permissions to create a transaction you will see the following screen.

After this point the server will take care of the payment and it will reply after the completition of it. This could be successful or a failure.

If the transaction is successful the callback will be executed to the url provided as "CallBackUrl" on the dashboard. This callback will include a post with the following parameters.

        $resultado = [
            "ct_order_id",
            "ct_token_tienda",
            "ct_monto",
            "ct_token_service",
            "ct_estado",
            "ct_authorization_code",
            "ct_payment_type_code",
            "ct_card_number",
            "ct_card_expiration_date",
            "ct_shares_number",
            "ct_accounting_date",
            "ct_transaction_date",
            "ct_order_id_mall",
            "ct_firma",
        ];

Where ct_order_id corresponds to the "Your" order identification ( Store's order id ).


### Verifying the response.

The response in the last section is signed. What we need to do is check if the signature corresponds.





#### Successful Reply
On a successful reply the answer will be like tho following :

    {
    "detalles_transaccion": {
      "order_id": 63,
      "authorization_code": "1213",
      "payment_type_code": "VN",

      "transaction_date": "2016-06-16"
      }
    }
